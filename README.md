# Social Feed – Frontend Learning Project

This is a simple social feed project built with **React.js**, **CSS**, and **HTML** as part of my frontend learning journey in 2023.

The main goal was to practice component structure, styling, and basic usage of libraries like `date-fns` and `phosphor-react`.
